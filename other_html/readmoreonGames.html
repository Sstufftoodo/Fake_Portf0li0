					<h2>I use GODOT for my game engine <br>To make RPG type of games</h2>
					<p>Godot is a beast. Completely built by its community, fully open source, and entirely free. It excels in 3d is great for 2d and is now being used by major studios. You literally can't get a better deal as a small studio than free. Actually free. Not free with royalties. Real free. Use Godot. Seriously. Godot was used to make Dome Keeper and Endoparasitic.</p>

					<h2>And of one of my favorite 2D game engine.. <br> GameMaker</h2>
					<p>GameMaker is a great engine for making 2d games but not very strong with 3d. You can use the free trial indefinitely for non-commercial use and it allows exports to Desktop targets as well as Web and Mobile. The monetization model is very competitive at 100$ one time for a lifetime license. For Console it's 80$ per month or 800$ per year. All of these prices have regionalized pricing making it affordable pretty much anywhere. They don't take royalties which is pretty great if your game takes off as well. Game Maker Studio was used to make Heartbound, Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Pizza Tower and Undertale.</p>
